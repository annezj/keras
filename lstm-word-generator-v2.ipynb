      "I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to...\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Is there more to this recording?\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble. It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has become a bit eccentric.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking about?\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better play back the whole thing.\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be able to play back the entire recording.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me if I take this off! Okay.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back the entire message.\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty innards!\n",
      "AUNT BERU: \n",
      "Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight flutter.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back.\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "     (to Artoo)Just you reconsider playing that message for him.\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "No, I don't think he likes you at all.\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "No, I don't like you either.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.\n",
      "OWEN: \n",
      "What makes you think that?\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.\n",
      "OWEN: \n",
      "That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. It belongs to us now.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?\n",
      "OWEN: \n",
      "He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the same time as your father.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "He knew my father?\n",
      "OWEN: \n",
      "I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge working out those condensers.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine. In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to transmit my application to the Academy this year.\n",
      "OWEN: \n",
      "You mean the next semester before harvest?\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Sure, there're more than enough droids.\n",
      "OWEN: \n",
      "Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year.\n",
      "OWEN: \n",
      "You must understand I need you here, Luke.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "But it's a whole 'nother year.\n",
      "OWEN: \n",
      "Look, it's only one more season.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.\n",
      "AUNT BERU: \n",
      "Where are you going?\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those droids.\n",
      "AUNT BERU: \n",
      "Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have gone. It means so much to him.\n",
      "OWEN: \n",
      "I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.\n",
      "AUNT BERU: \n",
      "Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his father in him.\n",
      "OWEN: \n",
      "That's what I'm afraid of.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "What are you doing hiding there?\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about his mission.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Oh, no!\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at times.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to wait until morning.\n",
      "OWEN: \n",
      "Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of trouble.\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "Oh, he excels at that, sir.\n",
      "OWEN: \n",
      "Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be loafing now!\n",
      "OWEN: \n",
      "Have you seen Luke this morning?\n",
      "AUNT BERU: \n",
      "He said he had some things to do before he started today, so he left early.\n",
      "OWEN: \n",
      "Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him?\n",
      "AUNT BERU: \n",
      "I think so.\n",
      "OWEN: \n",
      "Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired be midday or there'll be hell to pay!\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "     (yelling)How's that.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far. We must have missed him. Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "     (brightening)Sure. He needs you. He'd probably only deactivate you for a day or so...\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed his restraining bolt...\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like our droid... hit the accelerator.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish... and don't talk to me about your mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million pieces right here.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back before Uncle Owen really blows up.\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your workshop.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "No, he's not going to try anything.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "What's wrong with him now?\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "Oh my... sir, he says there are several creatures approaching from the southeast.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any... wait a second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "Don't worry, he'll be all right.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "What happened?\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're still in one piece.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you!\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young Luke, what brings you out this far?\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former master... I've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking about?\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "Obi-Wan Kenobi... Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a long time... a long time.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "Oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "You know him!\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Then the droid does belong to you.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting...\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Threepio!\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "Where am I? I must have taken a bad step...\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the Sandpeople return.\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "Quickly, son... they're on the move.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a spice freighter.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten involved.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "You fought in the Clone Wars?\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "I wish I'd known him.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior. I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a good friend. Which reminds me...\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic crusade like your father did.\n",
      "THREEPIO: \n",
      "Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for awhile.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Sure, go ahead.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "What is it?\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or as random as a blaster.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "How did my father die?\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "The Force?\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us. It binds the galaxy together.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little friend. And where you come from.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "I saw part of the message he was...\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "I seem to have found it.\n",
      "LEIA: \n",
      "General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire. I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2 unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour. Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to Alderaan.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "     (laughing)Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "That's your uncle talking.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "     (sighing)Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain this?\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "Learn about the Force, Luke.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "You must do what you feel is right, of course.\n",
      "TAGGE: \n",
      "Until this battle station is fully operational we are vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more dangerous than you realize.\n",
      "MOTTI: \n",
      "Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle station!\n",
      "TAGGE: \n",
      "The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial Senate as long as....\n",
      "TARKIN: \n",
      "The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us. I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.\n",
      "TAGGE: \n",
      "That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy?\n",
      "TARKIN: \n",
      "The regional governors now have direct control over territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this battle station.\n",
      "TAGGE: \n",
      "And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.\n",
      "VADER: \n",
      "The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.\n",
      "MOTTI: \n",
      "Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use it!\n",
      "VADER: \n",
      "Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.\n",
      "MOTTI: \n",
      "Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader. Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the Rebel's hidden fort...\n",
      "VADER: \n",
      "I find your lack of faith disturbing.\n",
      "TARKIN: \n",
      "Enough of this! Vader, release him!\n",
      "VADER: \n",
      "As you wish.\n",
      "TARKIN: \n",
      "This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just... I never heard of them hitting anything this big before.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they sold them to. And that would lead them home!\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!\n",
      "VADER: \n",
      "And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your hidden Rebel base.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there. You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of the Empire.\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my father.\n",
      "BEN: \n",
      "Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. We must be cautious.\n",
      "TROOPER: \n",
      "How long have you had these droids?\n",
      "LUKE: \n",
      "About three or four seasons.\n",
